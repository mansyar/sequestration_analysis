# Analysis of "From FOLU Net Sink to Net Zero" Proposal

## Executive Summary

The document proposes a **Compliance-Based Sequestration Certificate Scheme** for Indonesia, modelled after Australia's **Large-scale Generation Certificate (LGC)** scheme. The core argument is to transition from voluntary offsets to a mandatory compliance market to bridge the implementation gap in Indonesia's FOLU (Forestry and Other Land Use) Net Sink strategy.

While the "compliance market" approach is sound in principle, several critical logic gaps and structural flaws exist in the direct transposition of the LGC model (energy) to the biological carbon sector (forestry).

## Identified Gaps and Flaws

### 1. The "Permanence" & Reversal Gap (Critical)

**Logic Flaw:** The LGC model is based on **electricity generation**, which is instantaneous and irreversible. Once 1 MWh is generated, it cannot be "ungenerated."
**Context:** Forest carbon is **non-permanent**. A forest credited today can burn down or be logged tomorrow (Reversal Risk).
**Missing Mechanism:** The proposal does not define how the certificate scheme handles reversals.

- Does the certificate expire?
- Is there a "buffer pool" (like Verra uses)?
- If a liable entity surrenders a certificate for compliance, and the forest subsequently burns, is the entity liable again?
  **Impact:** Without a mechanism for permanence (which LGCs do not need), the certificates may lack environmental integrity.

### 2. The Ex-Post Financing Dilemma

**Logic Flaw:** The paper argues the scheme will "accelerate capital-intensive mitigation actions."
**Context:** LGCs are issued **Ex-Post** (after generation).
**Gap:** New restoration projects (plantations/mangroves) require massive **upfront capital (Ex-Ante)** and take years to sequester significant carbon (Execution Lag).

- If certificates are only issued upon verified sequestration (Ex-Post), project developers face a "valley of death" for 5-10 years before revenue starts.
- Unlike solar farms (which generate revenue/electricity quickly), trees grow slowly.
  **Impact:** The mechanism fails to solve the "financing mobilisation" problem for _new_ projects unless it allows for forward-crediting (which risks integrity) or includes a secondary lending market.

### 3. Additionality and "Existing" vs. "New" Supply

**Logic Flaw:** The LGC scheme was designed to force _new_ entry (renewable target).
**Context:** The paper mentions "Sustainable Forest Management" (SFM) and "Protection" as eligible activities.
**Gap:** If existing forests or slight improvements in standard logging (SFM) generate certificates, the market could be flooded with cheap, low-quality supply.

- This significantly lowers the certificate price.
- **Result:** It becomes cheaper for liable entities to buy "protection" certs than to invest in expensive _new_ restoration/mangrove projects.
  **Impact:** The scheme might fail to drive the _new_ sequestration capacity needed for the Net Zero wedge.

### 4. Demand Structure limits (The "PLN Constraint")

**Logic Flaw:** The paper cites Australia's "liability on retailers" as a success factor.
**Context:** In Indonesia, the primary energy "retailer" is **PLN** (State-owned).
**Gap:** If the "Liable Entities" are dominated by PLN or state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the "market" is effectively an internal government transfer or a state-mandated tax.

- The paper suggests extending to "extractive industries," which is crucial.
- Without diverse private demand, the "market signal" is just a government regulated price, negating the efficiency benefits of a market mechanism.

### 5. "Non-Offset" Terminology

**Semantics:** The paper insists the scheme is "non-offset."
**Reality:** If a Fossil Fuel entity emits X and surrenders a Sequestration Certificate Y to Net Zero, **that is the definition of an offset**.

- Distinguishing it as "compliance-based" is correct, but calling it "non-offset" is confusing and conceptually inaccurate. It is a "Compliance Offset" (like the old CDM or California's Cap-and-Trade land offsets).

## Recommendations for Strengthening

1.  **Define a Permanence Mechanism:** Propose a "Buffer" where a % of certificates are withheld to cover potential reversal, or a "Temporary Certificate" model (tCER).
2.  **Distinguish Vintages/Classes:** Separate "Restoration Certificates" (New Sink) from "Protection Certificates" (Avoided Emission) to prevent price suppression of restoration projects.
3.  **Address Upfront Finance:** Explain how the certificate guarantees future revenue to secure banking loans for initial planting costs.
4.  **Clarify Liability:** Explicitly map out private sector liability beyond SOEs to ensure true market liquidity.
